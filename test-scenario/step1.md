This is the first step in the tutorial!

Start with cloning the repo with the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/katacoda/scenario-examples.git katacoda-scenario-examples`{{execute}}

The scenario you are currently reading is in the directory `ls -lha katacoda-scenario-examples/create-scenario-101`{{execute}}. The directory name is what defines the URL.
